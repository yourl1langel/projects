<div class="tab">We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza
shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not scouring the globe
(okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest
ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your
family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to
crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks
Pizza is baked with love.</div>

<div class="tab"> After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in
Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one
topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004,
Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style
pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern
and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go. Okotoks
Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella,
roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium
toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a
healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good
about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always
ready to make you more.</div>
