                        “Hand’s down the best pizza restaurant I’ve yet
                        to find in okotoks, and light years beyond anything I’ve tried on
                        Commercial drive, okotoks Pizza offers by far the most impressive
                        lineup of pizzas I’ve witnessed. On a given Friday night expect
                        to find at least seven or eight different pizzas fresh from the
                        oven to sample. None of the standard meat lover’s or Hawaiian
                        varieties either, each pizza offered is totally unique with high
                        quality toppings and ingenious combinations. The owner is often on hand,
                        and willingly gives out samples to aid customers in their choice.
                        Staff is unbelievably friendly, and prices are very competitive
                        considering how much they exceed quality expectations for a by
                        the slice pizza joint.”

                            30 mins before closing. Extremely satisfied! Cheese is great, the
                            dough is great, the temperature was great. Customer service was great.
